Text-Statistics-Latin version 0.06
==================================

ABSTRACT

This module performs statistical nalisys (2) of corpora (1).

DESCRIPTION

Given a copus as input, Text::Statistics::Latin creates a seven column
CSV file as output, with one line for each token per text. Names of
input files need match the following pattern:

    1 (1). txt', '1 (2). txt', ..., '1 (n).txt'

or

    1 \(([1-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)\)\.txt

Columns store statistical information:

    (1) number of word forms in document d;  
    (2) number of tokens in d;  
    (3) Id number of d, ie., n;  
    (4) frequency of term t in d;  
    (5) corpus frequency of t ;  
    (6) document frequency of t (number of documents where t occurs at
+ least once);  
    (7) t, UTF8 latin coded token-string delimited by C<< /[ -@]|[\[-`
+]|[{-Â¿]|[&#592;-&#745;]|[&#884;-&#65533;]/ >>
     
    Main output file name is '1 (n + 5).txt' and it is stored in the s
+ame directory as
    the corpus, together with residual files on each input file with .
+txu and .txv ad hoc extensions.  
     
    This code was written under CAPES BEX-09323-5

    #!/usr/bin/perl  
    use strict;  
    use Text::CStatiBR;  

    &Text::CStatiBR::CSTATIBR("5");     #5 files are analised.  
                                        #Main output
                                        #file created is  
                                        #1 (10).txt
